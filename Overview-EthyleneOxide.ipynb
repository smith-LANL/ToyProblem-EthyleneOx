    "# Intentions\n",
    "This is a relatively simple example of multi-physics modeling. It requires coupling models from different disciplines (physical/chemical/engineering models). It entails models of differing fidelity — potentially allowing the exploration of model-form error. It requires numerical calculation — potentially providing an example for verification and the effects of numerical error on validation / uncertainty quantification (V/UQ). It is developed as a pedagogical problem in the sense that there is a system in place for a 'hidden' high-fidelity model that is used to represent reality and from which hypothetical experimental values can be drawn. The hope is that it provides a useful test bed for V/UQ techniques and that it illustrates the messiness of both models and experiments in the real world."

    "# Ethylene Oxide & Its Production\n",
    "Ethylene oxide is the main component in thermobaric weapons, but is produced primarily as a feed stock for ethylene glycol (which in turn is used to produce polyester, antifreeze and many other products). Large-scale production started in WWI as a feed-stock for mustard gas. It was [first patented in the US](https://patents.google.com/patent/US1998878A/enhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US1998878A/en) in 1931 leading to a Union-Carbide plant in 1937. In 1958 Shell Oil Co. improved the process by using pure oxygen in place of air and by shifting operations to the range of $200-300^{\\circ}$C and $1-3$MPa. By the mid. 1970s the Shell improvements had taken over the industry, but nitrogen was still sometimes used to moderate temperature. Ethylene-oxide's production has grown to account for 11% of all ethylene and use has grown to the point that the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers association [has referred to it](https://www.afpm.org/newsroom/blog/ethylene-worlds-most-important-chemicalhttps://www.afpm.org/newsroom/blog/ethylene-worlds-most-important-chemical) as, \"**the world’s most important chemical**.\" *It isn't really the most important, but an argument could be made for inclusion in the top ten.*  \n",

    "The modeling of the reactor behavior is based on concepturally breaking the problem into two distinct continuum scales. First — on the large scale (meaning the length-scale of the reactor itself), the reactants are flowing primarily along the length of the reactor and are slowly being converted to products. Second — on a scale from tens of nano-meters to tens of micro-meters, the reactants must migrate from the bulk fluid through a film at the surface of the catalyst and further migrate partway into a pore where they react to products on the surface by some complex mechanism. And similarly, the reactants must migrate back out of the pores and through the film to the bulk flow.  \n",

This approach has the advantage of conserving the atomic elements as well at total mass. One way to formulate a model from a conservation principle is to set up a control volume ($V^{\\mathrm{control}}$, characterized by its cross-sectional area, $A^{\\mathrm{control}}$, and axial length, $\\Delta z$) and track the accumulation (time rate of change of the number, in moles, by integrating the molar concentration, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int \\!

    "This specifically refers to the geometric properties of the catalyst pellet such as its packed void fraction and surface properties including surface area, pore volume and pore radius.  \n",
    "The void fraction, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{void}}$, is simply the volume in the reactor that is not occupied by the catalyst pellets normalized by the total reactor volume. It is important because a given flow rate will flow through an open pipe more slowly than it will through the voids of a packed bed. These two velocities are referred to as 'superficial' velocity, $u_{\\mathrm{sup.}}$, and 'interstitial' velocity, $u$. And  \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{void}} u = u_{\\mathrm{sup.}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "For spherical pellets of equal size the packing of pellets is well studied. The minimum void fraction is given by spherical close packing and the maximum by lowest-density jammed packing: $0.26 \\le \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{sphere}} \\le 0.51$ with typical values for irregular packing of $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{sphere}} \\approx 0.36$. For cylinders of equal size, the packing will depend on the aspect ratio of the cylinder. For $L/D = 1$, the experimentally observed range is $0.29 \\le \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{cylinder}} \\le 0.40$ with typical values of $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{cylinder}} \\approx 0.35$; and for $L/D = 2$, typical values are $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{cylinder}} \\approx 0.40$.\n",

    "The properties of $A_{\\mathrm{cat.}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{pore}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{pore}}$,\n",
    "are unique in that there is no theory contributing to the modeling of the ethylene-oxide reactor. However, the experiment that determines these properties does rely on theory. Interestingly, the theory in the experiment requires simplifying assumptions in order to facilitate a linear inference of these 'measured' properties.  \n",
