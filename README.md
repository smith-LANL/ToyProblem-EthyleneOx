# Overview
Building on the [Ethylene-Oxide example provided by PhilipSmith-Canada](https://github.com/PhilipSmith-Canada/EthyleneOxideHomeWork), this project provides a simplified simulation of a fixed-bed heterogeneous catalytic reactor for ethylene-oxide production. It is not intended for physically accurate prediction, but as a simplified toy problem that illustrates the complexities of multi-physics, multi-scale modeling as as example application for validation/uncertainty-quantification techniques.
